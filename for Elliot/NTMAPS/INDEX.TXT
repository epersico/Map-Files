- dipfinder:

  input: (even period) bif-curve, (a,b)-range, shino-pt., split threshold
  output: even shino-curve of same p/q, (a,b) for which both curves split

- dipfinder2:
  
  same as dipfinder, but for sevearl bif-curves at once, automatically finds
  shinohara point for which curves correspond

- even-shino:

  finds even shinohara curve numerically

- even-shino2:

  same as even-shino, but uses more sophisticated bracketing/interpolation

- even-shino2a:

  same as even/shino2, but keeps x-value small (controlled 
  mod 1 instead of lift)

- even-shino2b:

  combines xroot and yroot (doesn't work)

- find1_1fractions:

  recursion to find all even period fractions below 1/1 with a certain
  minimal/maximal spacing

- findallorbitsnew:
  
  find all orbits of winding number q/p for a given a,b set.  
    Initialization
    Output setup
    Shino forward and backward limits
    Find root function via filter functions (note coo0 means odd-odd first version)
    use "zbrak" to find all the intervals where the two points bracket zero
    Find the roots using bisection method for all these brackets
    Calculate Residues
- findorbits: 

  find orbits of period q/p along a symmetry line, varying a or b

- f_iter: 

  show f_iter, the function of which minima/zeros have to be found for
  bif-curve/findorbits

- meander-windno:

  finds the winding number of the orbits starting with the shinohara points,
  varying a, b, in grids or along bif-curve

- ntstmap:

  non-twist standard map.
    basic structure:
      Load initialization File
      Prep Outputfiles
      Iterate all 4 Shinohara points 
      Iterate points above j0
      Iterate points below j0

- windo-profile:

  finds winding numbers for a y-range for x on a symmetry line, or parallel to
  it
